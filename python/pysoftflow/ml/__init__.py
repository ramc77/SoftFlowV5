"""Reduced-order ML layer — surrogate modelling, active learning, inverse design.

This package turns a SoftFlow parameter *sweep* (e.g. the 4x4 stenosis grid
in ``research/04_shear_activated_stenosis``) into a cheap, queryable model of
the input -> outcome map. It is intentionally **dependency-light**: only
NumPy and SciPy (both already required by SoftFlow). No PyTorch / scikit-learn.

What it provides
----------------
    dataset          — load a ``sweep_results.npz`` into a feature/target table
    surrogate        — a from-scratch Gaussian-process regressor with an
                       ARD-RBF kernel, marginal-likelihood hyperparameter fit,
                       closed-form leave-one-out CV, and ARD feature importance
    active_learning  — acquisition functions (max-variance / expected
                       improvement) that suggest the next simulation to run
    inverse_design   — optimise the surrogate to find the input that maximises
                       (or minimises) a chosen outcome

Design intent
-------------
With only ~16 labelled sweep cells, the right model is a Gaussian process,
not a deep network: it is data-efficient, gives calibrated uncertainty (which
drives active learning), and its ARD length-scales double as an interpretable
feature-importance measure. Deep models (CNN / LSTM / GNN) become feasible
only after active learning has grown the dataset.
