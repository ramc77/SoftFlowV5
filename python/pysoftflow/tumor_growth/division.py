"""Division kinetics for tumour-growth / aggregate-formation studies.

**Coarse-grained mechano-chemical proxy. Not a validated cancer
model.** This module models circulating-cell-style aggregation under
flow for methodological exploration and student training only — every
class docstring repeats this caveat per CLAUDE.md §7.4.

The canonical model (``StressNutrientDivision``) fires when:

  - Local fluid shear rate γ̇ is **below** ``stress_max`` (high shear
    fragments aggregates faster than they can replicate), and
  - Local nutrient concentration C is **above** ``nutrient_min``
    (the cell needs food to divide), and
  - A Poisson clock fires: ``rng() < k_div · dt``.

γ̇ is the magnitude of the local rate-of-strain tensor at the
parent's centroid (same probe used by Phase-4
``ShearTriggered`` kinetics). "Nutrient" is the concentration of a
designated scalar species — we don't simulate nutrient chemistry,
we simulate sigmoidal sensitivity to a designated trigger species
(same honest naming convention as Phase-4 ``PhTriggered``).

Custom division rules subclass ``DivisionKinetic`` and override
``can_divide``. The orchestrator never inspects subclass internals.
