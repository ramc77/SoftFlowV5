"""Phase-4 drug-delivery extensions.

Five release-kinetic models, wall-region absorbers, and metrics
(delivery efficiency, off-target fraction, residence-time
distribution, spatial dose map). All Python-side; the C++ chemistry
machinery (Fick leaching, finite reservoir M_p, Langmuir adsorption,
Peskin-spread fluxes) does the work, this layer schedules it.

Strong language constraint (CLAUDE.md §7.4 spirit / PROMPT.md Phase 4)
— this is a coarse-grained methodological-exploration toolkit, not a
validated drug-carrier or tissue-uptake model. Caveats live in
``examples/04_drug_delivery/README.md`` and ``docs/drug_delivery.md``.

Submodules:

    kinetics   — DiffusionControlled, FirstOrder, ShearTriggered,
                 PhTriggered, Burst
    absorbers  — WallAbsorber (first-order or Michaelis-Menten)
    metrics    — delivery_efficiency, off_target_fraction,
                 residence_time_distribution, spatial_dose_map
    runner     — DrugDeliveryRun orchestrator
